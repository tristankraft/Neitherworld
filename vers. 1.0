                                                             inside your mind when you die, a dream, and then doing something that makes you "die" in the dream brings you back to life.

                                                             a writer—an anything—who resolves to be with his mentally unstable partner instead of his craft

                                                             maybe there's a fascination with the other part, the non-compatable part, and all the anger and frustration that comes with trying to understand it. Maybe 50%—51%—is perfect.

The room doesn't matter much, maybe it's not real.

All theae different stories but we realize that they're the same person, but they're different outcomes of hos life after he's made different decisions. there is the constant opportunity to fix something reah out, contact contact contact. what does it mean and look like now when something is finally over? Tobacco is still in the future; tobacco keeps the population from rising too quickly. Every lives in a tiny space modular space. A kid in the future who's fascinated by a mobile home. What's happening to the guilty pleasure? everything on Facebook ip address. Maybe it’s a science fiction tv show. Amnesia break up, what is that like? All the things you say to each other lost forever.

        Future: fiction writers to get out aggression, human aspects. 3D printing. There was no turning back from plastic. ==On another planet, living in plastic structures, we dont know how long it's been or what happened. <Tom Sachs> But they had printed their houses and equipment and their ancestors had died if radiation. Tranquilizers run out. Is everybody the same age? Birthday. Modern gender dynamics. Defined by an absence of clutter. Child in a bunker doesn’t realize the world ends — subtle like real childhood." Theme: the struggle between a modern woman and a modern man defining that relationship.

      TV idea: space fagg•ts SF the computer is called cunt and makes fun of science fiction, breeders, roman soldiers. Being alone at the beach like being alone on a journey in space lame but think about it a space film where abigail does the costumes. Bipoloroid.

      a comedy about the amish

      now that there's just been human contact with aliens, looking back at before there was human contact with aliens

      if everything was created at the same time, wouldn't aliens be about the same as us?
      the difference in understanding them and the difference in understanding someone close to you. it's right there in front of you and so subtle but it's also a million miles away and it's the same.
      Maybe our first contact is their first contact
      maybe it's just like a date

      maybe from the POV of an alien who's about to meet a human

      slugs are aliens
      all animals are aliens
      rewrite the creation myth

      maybe aliens have been trying to contact us all along but in the wrong dimension, a dimension we can't experience
      maybe they don't have space and time
      maybe there's a meeting place exactly in the middle, where their time meets with ours and there's a brief profound understanding of where we're going because that's where they came from and we're also where they're going

      the amish are aliens

      maybe aliens smoke too

      disease from drinking liquid water on another planet

      maybe we don't make contact. maybe it's about another planet looking for contact, us, without finding it.

      maybe there are wormholes in the future and we were the ones who destroyed the dinosaurs. dropped a bomb on them. an accident. a child did it.

      innocence mixed with extreme perversion, lilt it's not perverse anymore

      a man who chronically masturbates but has this friendly relationship with a child once every day and that's his time out of the house. He's out with overalls cutting roses in the garden when she goes home from school. She sees him every day but only for that moment. And his day revolves around it. Everything else he does is worded. what would her perspective of it be. what would his perspective be. 

      don't move around too much when you're writing. it messes up the flow. especially maybe in dialogue, it'll seem forced. just say all the dialogue. say it out loud. 

      i need to get my word cunts up. get used to writing 3,000 words every day, even if they're stupid words. 

      sit at your desk tomorrow and don't think about what you're writing. email. copying something verbatim. just write the whole day and see how it feels. that's why you're down here. no more wasting days. its fun to write and you love the way it feels when you've finished doing it. Remember that. 

      maybe the above is a beginning of a story, a dated journal entry. then another a month later.
      actually make the dates all over the place. one from when he was 13 or so, then the one above, then another one at the end of his life. don't mention death, too easy, just show it in the dates. a book at the end of his life. what's it about? not dying.

      family and friends. different perspectives. a boy who's gay. a young girl who reveals that it's not a drill. she thinks its a drill at first. the paranoid mother. the quixotic father. the pervert somewhere.
      where does the paranoia come from? it's somewhere between her and another man. maybe a lover, who also comes along. she doesn't look like she has a lover but she does. 

      maybe i'll adhere to a formula for the first book and then realize i don't have to adhere to it and go back to my original struggle and then not use a formula for the second.

      earthquake in LA. That's a movie. no one wants to talk about it though. 
      tell a story from new york about the heyday of LA and how it's long over. it'd be slightly in the future. we think that he's being a snob about it but then we find out he's a jerk and it was the end of LA due to a huge, 7.6 or higher earthquake. the one geologists had predicted. make it sound like they knew, they this, they that, but in the end, "they" is not other cool people like the narrator, it's geologists.

      NEW an old man, who knows how to survive, but can't because he's feeble. he makes his way through the apocalypse but only because he's lucky. People may or may not take pity on him, IDK yet. but he stays alive. tell his story. 

      maybe all these stories are connected. and they're put into the story of what happens when the world collapses. no one knows why. but they're all different. and they move into each other? not necessarily. 

      Mimic. You're good at it, the only reason you don't do it is because you're too self conscious.

      what happens right when steve jobs' plan for the future of apple finally runs out. all the long long term plans written on napkins. it's all documented completely, and everyone can access it because it's in the memory of the device. but it's charted and it's finite and there's a diagram and there's marketing of when the device was created.
      apple communicating across all the tablets phones and devices, their disciples, like with  bibles. but don't actually say that. but people think it's the end of the world because the chart has run out. all of his writings are traced. and there's nothing more. documents like galileio
      but then someone finds one more on a napkin on a book
      and it's a stupid, perverted thing but they do it. 
      the eact words of the napkin will be funny
      sweat will that be like though, really?

      a guy who's sick of his girlfriend who wants to dump her but isn't man enough to. the thing that gets to him is how much she checks her phone. she checked her phone. she checked her phone.
      we hunk it's really annoying that she's doing it. but then we find out why. but mostly its a flip of perception. start like I'm complaining but then i'm not. 
      so we need it but we don't need it but we need it.

      martial law. right in the middle of it. second generation of people, who don't remember the apicalypse, and there's no hope in sight. they're born into it. and they're punks. there is no hope coming and theres ennui about how severe it was before. and they burn stuff
      basically that's that british movie with punks on criterion Jubilee
      but different. in text cleaner. no chaos, its martial law. and the punks are just bored. maybe they're not philosophical. what do they want? a good time. and make them seem right. don't give a glimmer of hope, make it the end. the fucked up. that's how society is ruined. it's crashed down by bored people. and there's no one who remembers it to start it again. and they kill all the people who resist. so its like martial law all over again and the people who are boring are put in houses, and forced to not like it. and that's the circle. society could have been gone a millennia ago, because that's the cycle, two generations. make the houses seem really old in the beginning. every thing looks like it's been there for a long time. 

      could maybe be a play. you're tricked to side with the punks at the beginning but then by the end you side with the people oppressed. and there's the flip with how long it's been going on. two different story lines. you like one at the beginning and you grow to like them less. you dislike the other one a lot at the beginning but then you do like him by the end. 
      brothers. twins. in the same house. one is submissive and the other is the punk. 
      its the intersecting story of their lives. b

      there's a bonb that goes off and there's a shut down of the government but everyone is really peaceful. it's counter intuitive to what people would expect. not analysts, they don't flinch in the story. but the reader will because they expect an aplcaypse.

      then it's a drug? it took a drug to mollify us? no that's too pessimistic. 
      sage bombs. cleared away the evil spirits. no. yeah, maybe that's it. make it seem like a warfare movie, but in the end you find it's an indian myth.

      no disaster at the end. just make them seem absolutely crazey.

      two preppers on a drill, in the wilderness and they're mauled by a bear that's the end. make it sort of seem like a drill.

      [all of these stories show how paranoid we are about the end of the world. maybe that's it. maybe we're made to be scared. by who?

      the government can find the preppers because they use the satellites they still have under their control to find them in the wilderness. wiping them out, taking their supplies. the paranoid voice of it happening comes on the ham radio. they get to the last one. and it's just a man.
      she says they're real. but he thinks they're just inflitrations of the government making him run. she has the opportunity to leave. but she chickens out. give her the decision. they attack. it's the last one ever. and they kill the family
      only the daughter survives, and she's taken prisoner to be raped.

      that's what's shaded, the libertarian part of it. maybe that's the whole book, maybe that's where the subtlety comes in. all these different stories, and they all could be post apocalyptic, or they could be today's unreliable narrators.

      that's where the subtlety and unreliable narrators come in.

      every story could be a piece of the chronology that comes beuidlign up to and after an apocalyptic event. everyone is potentially right, telling the story in the future/past or they are potentially an unreliable narrator telling a story about today.

      OTHER. roads get really wide. big. big enough that a whole city could evacuate itself on them
      a world where people are used to mass evacuations. a city does it twelve times a year. just for practice.
      side plot: someone who stays behind. people stay behind. tell it from the eyes of a child and it could be people leaving for the summer. just a girl and her family. its true. and its literal. they're the only ones who evacuate. thats ambiguous

      a moment when they have to eat the pet. 

      truck drivers retort the nation. a moving band of them. on the roads. some clearing. some for security. a traveling community

      a kid moving around to different bases, like an army brat. only the bases were set up by the parent. and there arent many left

      something to lower inhibitions. a new type of alcohol. or bootleg stuff.

      a pot grower in svabald. its the last strain.

      elevated house with a elliptical foxhole underneath. for watching. its a dummy house. empty. or looks empty. but in the ground underneath, there's a community. 

      maybe a world where these existed a long time ago. a relic from before the war. maybe someones not used to seeing them, and its strange when they do, means something. 

      maybe put the writer in the middle. calling attention to whether or not its fiction or not. he also fits into the story because he's alone, without power and he's noticing the world ending but it doesnt effect him enoughh. but maybe on another level, he's calling attention to the fact that this could be made up. it could be literal. this is like breaking the 4th wall.

      maybe a joke about the publishing industry in there.he was going with a certain publisher because he likes the designers there. he's talking about it ending but maybe it's ended because the world has ended

      call it levels. as in underground community levels. 

      put one of everything in here. a horror story. make it a commentary on different styles. all styles. this is ambitions, don't kill yourself.

      in the show, the dad who gets his kids to eat bugs and prep for a dirty bomb, is actually a pretty good dad, his kids are open minded and pretty happy. not really brainwashed, just relaxed and smart

      didn't pack the right clothes. she grew, and its her bug out bag and the sizes are too small. awkwardness in there.

      what if there are bots grown into bullets. small computers, that go back.

      what if time all together creates this other, three-d world. if you look at time all at once, it's like a world with things on it. 
      people had to die here and here to bring on something else.

      in a 3d world, something is either there or not there. there's no memory of it, expectation for it to be there.

      and there are predators on that 4d world. looking at time as if its a painting. maybe our path through the universe is something pretty
      fireworks. out entire universe is some other dimension's bottle rocket.

      infinitely smaller, infinitely bigger.

      or more precise. some 4dbeing trying to pick off potential geniuses. maybe because they evolve. maybe because they taste good. but the icea of them being picked off. moved up. moved into something else.

      the pitfalls of going to space with companies making the parts
      theres one company that offers it cheaper but its very dangerous. "safer than falling" or some stupid tagline

      companies qualified to do different things. cargo, personnel, etc. everyone has one. some companies have better ones. some crappy ones.
      then they can set up defense from the air. with space travel they can take weapons into space and spy on other companies. its all done from the air.

      a robot who does that. looks only down at the thing in front of him, the task or the command or the person. that's what's simple about them. the thing that will separate them from out intelligence. not AI, we can't get there. everyone seems to think that we will but we won't. 

      maybe the

      one sappy theme for each character in a narration. not related. but they each adhere to a very predictible theme. but make them all collide in the middle. not like a formula. but make the really boring really interesting again.

      what if creating a universe is like a project for a 5-D being. that's why it's not perfect, it was created by a student. there will be more and more universes like ours. infinity of space so there's infinity of time. and infinity of something else. the 5th demension. whatever that is.

      we are going to colonize space but in the private sector. governments dont get crushed in the tech revolution, they just become irrelevant. it becomes a world government. individual govts couldnt sustain space but the private sector could. govt operations in space. same as on earth but in space. the belt. a belt of satellites. bound together. like a ring around saturn. you can see it from earth. 

      the tech revolution. that's serious. the tech takeover. its like religion. in the sceme of the world. religion secular religion. 

      dreams are the fifth dimension. skips in time. and matter. space meets time there. we control space and time in dreams? No. we don't control time. but we're receptive to it in a different way. 

      sleep is a luxury. humanity didn't always get as much. maybe we get more and more. or closer and closer to it. drugs are a dream. no money would give us more time to dream. art in the world if there were no money. thats a side idea. conected but also its own idea.

      world where people sacrifice themselves for science. they're family is attributed to science. like a donor. testing moves much faster because people will subscribe to new drugs because it advances society's understanding of it. even if they die.

      what if you set the wrong utensils for a meal at a restaurant. forks with applesauce

      BIG: the writer is telling a story of a bird over a field and something happens to the bird. it falls on a cross but it's impaled. Analog for what the writer is doing. birdseye view of the whole thing.

      people who come to use off-the-grid computers. like an internet cafe but with computers that are offline completely. bc now everything is connected. call them internet cafes.

      how would that happen. being offline. and what would happen?

      novel of a crazed writer going off alone. it's not his book but his diary. everything he listens to, everything he does, it's all logged. and he's trying to write a novel but he can't. but he ends up writing a novel anyway. and he's going crazy. but maybe in the end he's fine and it was a joke. maybe it could be ambiguous. whether or hot he's crazy. or violent. suspense mixed in. what other styles? copy all the styles, make it postmodern. all the styles. maybe he mimics stuff in the books. he writs stuff out to have it in his fingers. copy passages directly. then toy with them. like he's doing it. Perception as the name of the boat. at his beach meltdown. he fantasizes about a murder. but it's ihs diary and he's a fiction writer, so we don't know if its fantasy or fiction or if it actually happened. and imt the wroter, so i wrote it. but maybe just quote the fuck out of everything. make it shameless. talk about what music he listens to. maybe it's stream of consciousness at times. but he catalogues everything. maybe he's a terrible writer. make his own writing god awful, it could be funny that way. he's all alone. maybe there's doubt about whether his frieds really exist. and the ending. he's going to the beach. te after life. he's recalling going there. and it's the end of the world. why would the book end there? because he's in the boat and he gets there. but he's out of food and water b/c he's hiding from the police but are the police even there? Did he really do it? Maybe in the real world he's running out of paper or he drops the rest of the manuscript in water. maybe the end is waterlogged font. he's always said that he would do this once. or he's become spiritual and he's going to tak it as a sign if his manuscruiipt were to be harmed. or maimed. He wouldn't do it again. so he kills his friends on the boar or f kills a and he kills f. territorial. or there are violent undertones. it doesn't have to be a murder. how do you prove that he's going crazy? Bc there's a parallel in real life at all times. the stuff he does he's left society bc everyone braggs about what they do all the time and he basically does the same thing to his journal. it's about isolating yourself. that will come with all this technology. but the styles: try them all. horror. humor. detective novel. vampires. naturism. he looks at fauna on the beach. nah, that's detail. styles. romance novels. smut. pulp fiction. dialect. meyybe he writes in dialect.

      maybe he's on drugs, too.

      what if we all get along. and the world ending is too much. 

      transporting us to another place at the speed of light. our genetic dna. we're recreated there. we're just broadcast. everything about us at a certain moment.
      or its when the dna scan happens. so we're sent to another planet a copy thats two weeks old. and something happens in the two weeks after broadcast.

      that's teleportation. but the time it takes still has to elapse. so we get to another goldi locks planet and that's 1,000 light years away, and in that time a few humans stayed alive on earth. and they've evolved. and there's two species of humans.

      eh: a party and everyone's there. but it's a ship leaving earth.

      the hoodie. bad people always wearing hoodies.
      people living in the country because it's safer

      what if someone is finding out that they're a clone. but they're a clone of a human race long extinct. a past civil war. they're just like us but they descended from clones humans created. how would they be different? maybe they're not. maybe they are. clones that colonized the galaxy. then they try to figure out where they're from. how would they find out? but they find out. 
      maybe we're already clones

      the "travelers" in new york. 

      other: from the perspective of a rapist. that's the perceptive twist. we find out at the end that he's been raping all along. 

      a goldilocks planet but there's something wrong with it. exactly as it should be but something is wrong. what is it? black people? homosexuals. it's all homosexuals. and they breed with test tubes. every year they have to give in a sample of their sperm. the deposit. deposit time. or it's once a month. like a salary. and it's frozen. it's strange for a woman to do it. maybe we find out the woman's perspective after the man's. and hers is more painful. 
      everyone's name is a letter, so we don't realize that it's homosexual at first. only likes to 69 and it's a concern for the main character. 

      maybe they are woven together. and we can't figure out why. not woven together but chopped up. and we can't figure out why. then we do, right at the last minute. that's cheap maybe.


      what if we find other humans in the world and their only difference is that they speak a diferent language. that's all.
      or that they're much more attractive than us. and they like us and we breed with them. 
      it's a taboo thing but we have places of meeting them. 

      sci fi in sex. sex in sci fi. what could be sci fi about sex. that's how they make first contact, aliens, through sex. they don't look different and they're amazing at sucking dick. whores. every whore is an alien. no, that's not the one. she sucked dick like an alien. All Simon knew is that she sucked dick like an alien.

      the sea. we can live after the apocalypse under the sea. it'll freeze over and we'll have to go under it. there's a technology boom and the boom is sea vessels. just the same as underground but when you get to the surface it's an ocean.

      the breeding foxes thing. set something there. about how we haven't had time to breed out the stupid stuff. no: it's a war wherein all the stupid people killed each other. it was a war, but a few kind hippies survived. it jump started the species by about a milennia, with all the adrenaline that had been wiped out. theyr'e in the ukraine and they're running these tests on the foxes but the world is ending outside them with agression. and they're mostly lesbian. only when a man is suitable to breed do they let him breed. forget the fox thing. and the hostile young children are maimed. (this could be bigger idea) and there's weird sex stuff with the maimed children/men. there's an outsider. he had been maimed since before puberty for being so agressive. he gets angry all the time. even the other maimed ones don't like him. he's killed someone, but they've maimed him. it's corporal punishment but it's straight for the dick. the people who do bad things get taken out of the gene pool. straight for the dick is the title. 

      noa's ark: the computer with all the genetic makeup of the world. binary then to dna code. it has the whole planet on it. if it were a stupid movie, the harddrive containing it would be missing. (have an aspect, just a touch, of action.) it has everything, it's just that the data has to be moved. how is it moved. by usps. too much. by courier. someone trying to get to the transponder. the last one. the only one. but does he make it?

      story about finding a new world. the goldilocks planet. but it's a video game. there's two stories. maybe they're supposed to be connected. the first is optimistic. the second is bleak. but the second makes the first possibly bleaker, or invalid. which one is true?

      what if we're still industrial when we get to a new planet. what if industry is what we go through on every planet we find. we're trapped by industry. we evolve out of it into Green. Or maybe Blue. but we need industry first.

      maybe we evacuate earth. and africa can't afford it. so they can't leave. from the perspective of people left. maybe they fight. maybe it;s a terrorism story. but they're terrorising the people who leave, because they're stuck behind.

      civ story. "he typed in happiness" starting line

      order within nature. not ignoring it but leaving it wild. that's a thing for ADL but also a thing for the future. 

      everything is surrogate. even the families. the "families" are assigned by people, based on their genetics. people were still allowed to fuck anyone they want but babies are reassigned based on genetics, personality type. this is a whole novel. or if its the BIG then it could be told through the eyes of a teenager. this isn't my family. BIG: maybe tie them together but make even that ambiguous. like the same company but describing it not mentioning it. like with adverbs. make only six adverbs in the whole book, and each one is the thing that ties it together. each one
      [dr clark: adverbs don't add anything. oh, build that into the writer story. the thing that tells what's tying everything together. it's the part where he's learning the ideas of writing but he's also alone in the world. add that sentence, "adverbs don't add anything. maybe even play with caps. making the adverb begin the sentence so it's caps

      so the families. its the little girl and. she's like this is not my family. and it isn't. the families have been arranged based on genetically predictable personality types. (maybe it's the zodiac, haha) it's the sex story. because people in the future can still fuck anyone they want, but the babies are switched. genetics can't breed healthy babies as well as humans can. is that true? i don't think so. maybe ethethics got in the way. saying that we have to allow humans to breed (liberal) but they can be reassigned based on (conservative) science. maybe there's that struggle, too. humans to breed because sex is totally ok. no more stds so we just fuck all the time. the idea of a baby is ok
      if they were to give up for adoption it could be their own idea, too, they could have agency in it. Agency is the name of it. Agency. maybe the baby thing is easy, just an on and off switch. she uses a fertility app to turn on her pregnancy. or maybe a little girl is using her phone and she finds her way to the app and she turns it on too soon. by accident? no. haha: if it were a stupid movie, she would turn on the phone having sex, thinking about it but deciding not to but forgettting to turn the screen away and then she has sex and while they're having sex they brush the screen and turn it on. that's so stupid. good one. BIG: maybe the writer starts talking to himself. maybe that's a thing in one of the books. whether or not he's talking to himself. or a character who talks to himself, there's dialogue but the .

      [start writing before you figure this all out. you can add it and refine it in revisions. if you wait until the idea is perfect and the execution isn't nearly as refined, then you'll get stuck. START WRITING NOW. 

      maybe the writer hasn't started yet, he's freaking out about what to do because he's past the deadline. but the deadline was a nickname for an apocalypse. (i don'e know if this fits or if it's even funny. he's not on a deadline. no one is. he just keeps ssaying he's late with this. it has to be done tomorrow. because the world has ended but he doesn't have much time. don't mention the word deadline. but do mention that the name of an attack or a bomb or something catestrophic is called deadline. this started off as a writer who's going crazy. maybe don't do that, it's too self reflexive. unless the story is told in a paniced. way. a bad way. would the blind writer who's telling a story fit in here? maybe he tells it blind because all the editors are dead. that's why no one fixes it. it's the blind story of the writer on the beach talking about learning how to write for the first time because the world has ended. something's not quite right. but the editor's dead part is pretty funny. all the editors had died in the apocalypse. 

      maybe one of the characters is an editor and he mentions that he's the last one.

      At this time, the Big Bang, all the matter in the universe, would have been on top of itself. The density would have been infinite. It would have been what is called, a singularity. At a singularity, all the laws of physics would have broken down. This means that the state of the universe, after the Big Bang, will not depend on anything that may have happened before, because the deterministic laws that govern the universe will break down in the Big Bang. The universe will evolve from the Big Bang, completely independently of what it was like before.

      It was his first shower high. And it was the best shower of his life. He had gotten a little weed from his neighbor. 

      He had showered drunk before. Yes he had. But that was something else. He was up there, now, noticing every noticeable surrounding. Never before had he experienced the clean like this. He felt like the first man to stand naked beneath a warm waterfall coalescing with a warm smooth thing he was rubbing on his body. He thought about what warm smooth thing the first man might have used—a rock, probably. And now here he was, stoned, thinking about how now Man had soap, and he felt every lathery stroke, and he was discovering crevices and the idea of the word glycerine sounded almost onomatopoeic... gly-cer-ine. There was the smell of the soap, too, green tea something-or-other, and it smelled orgiastic. He started to laugh at himself thinking it. His estrogen must be going crazy. Had he eaten a lot of tofu? I don't know. Maybe. Yes, actually. Tofu never perished, or seemed like it didn't. He had a lot of that around.


      He also hadn't showered in a week.

      First of all: sustainably made: it decomposts in 40 years. If you bury it, potatos will grow. or some other seeds imbedded in it. even the packaging has to be used in the game somehow.

      purpose: working with others, not against them. (like socialism, a board game)

      money vs. moral currency
      goal to start with money and convert it all to moral currency? Money loses value but moral currency has constant value. Can a player buy moral currency with currency? No. they have to buy something else
      examples: 
      earn $1 moral currency from trading of Kombucha spawn
      let former oil executive join uyour post-apocalyptic living situation, earn 10 moral currency and $100,000,000

      supplies for yourself

      Yeah, I was hoping you'd say that. 
      Wait, what if we run out of that?
      We won't. We have a bottle left.
      What if it breaks?
      Shit, that's a connundrum.
      What does that leave you with? Salt and pepper.
      We're out of salt.

      Almost. Yes.
      What does almost mean?
      There's some behind the counter over there.
      Gross. That's desperate. Why? 
      Superstition.

      Anyway. You would season my sweet sweet flesh with salt from the crack over there.
      If it came to it.
      If it came to it. At least we have pepper.
      Plenty of it.
      How did you manage to stockpile more pepper than salt?
      ...
      What would you eat first?
      Your pussy.

      and maybe she chose it to be the last step. she recorded these last moments with her best friends
      here because she's a planner and she wanted them to take this step together.
      and the step was quickly taken
      [maybe, maybe no] and maybe taken from her by the end of the world. she rejects that it's happening this way.

      the story about the conservationist, the one who buys the properties. he’s killed by something wild. something in the woods he restores. a wolf. an animal. his animal. 

      leaving the beach. the whistle of the lifeguards. the waves picking up.
      walking over the bridge the chesapeake bridge. the crack at the bottom between the railing. there’s 15 stories between you and the water. many of the things that you think you need and hold dear could fall down the crack to the water, gone unless you had the means to recover them, even so they’d be broken. that’s how we live now. holding on to things that we think are permanent but they can fall through a crack. 

      the complete opposite thing. the cult that does things in complete opposites. not a cult—the native american thing. reference that. then the couple. or a couple. and they’re complete opposites. maybe that’s the play. and the f. character is taking both their sides.

[new idea: the people of the future will look back at us as the fanatacists of the past, but it’s like the midieval era, where we were fanatacists about God, to us. people would die for a belief in something. and there was a war of the corporations and the corporations all ended up making it through, but all these innocent people died for no reason] but mostly those people didn’t know what to do for just one second, and then they all typed Yahoo.

      ok clear your minds for a second. because I need you to not interject until I’m done. because i’m about to pay you a copliment and you may ruin the flow of it if you interrupt, and i’m not trying to offend you. quuite the opposite. i’m about to give a literary analysis of the whole thing. You two have a leader–sidekick aspect to you, and it’s not the unsuccessful kind where the leader is smart and the sidekick is dumb; that relationship happens o,m.lwqm.ten and it’s not the kind I mean, I mean the kind that had existed before Don Quichotte but happened first in literature with Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. One of you has an IQ and the other has and EQ. And you’re both comfortablewith the other’s sense of humor and that’s what makes you friends. But you compliment each other and that’s what makes you partners. I mean to add that both of you have EQs and IQs ut each of you has a strong one. And each of you are searching for what the other has. Searching in an inocent way. T, you search for a place that harmonizes with who you are as a person. P, you search for a way to always be sharper.

May not work if there’s Keno but you may not need Keno. Maybe some other propellant. 
      [I got to meet people in Solomons, but here it’s different. The people have been here for a long time. they’re rooted in here. They’ve seen here over and over again, and the changes in it, and their fascination with them, are not shallow to them, not something to pass the time, there’s a general concern with them. And on top of that. They’re seen you before, they know you. what else you got? There’s a deepness in that. The We’re getting to know you. I am who I am and I’m not too concerned with changing (I could, you know, I really could, but perhaps I’ve already changed in the pursuit of myself, and I’ve arrived.) They question you and prod you, not in a caddy way but in a soft-but-assertive way. This is who I am and I’m going to brush up against you a little bit to see who I am. 
      I actually like bartending. I like to tallk to people. I like it when they cut the shit and actually have a conversation with it. Sometimes they come out and have it with you and sometimes you have to go searching for it a bit, but every so often you have these conversations. That’s what I get from this. I get a real conversation between two strangers. I like to learn and sharpen my brain with the flow part of it, the opening bottles in time and mixing drinks correctly faster and faster each time, and the Ps & Qs of really good service, and then dutimately doing all that while you have a real conversation, but it’s the real converstaions. I got that sometimes, through a lot of bullshit around me because of the restaurant and because of the people who travel to Solomons—and in some ways it was better because people vacationed there, they were less guarded, less mired in their proper lives, their IQ lives, and more in their EQ lives—but I’m getting more of it here. At least a differeny kind of it. A more consistent EW part of it.  ku tclt7lgtiubu jk

      The spider living in the living wall. It’s dying. He doesn’t know why, it looks like what he knew. 
      It’s the mirror. It’s not us. Something is happening in the fifth dimension. 
      It’s spiritual nihilism. The idea that there’s nothing we can do but evolve. Stop Looking! Is their chant. 
      It’s cultural terrorism. That story. There’s a good team and there’s a bad team. It’s arbitrary. They go back and forth between good and bad. They all work together in the end anyway. Told through the police and the Tourstz. So we get the police drama and the action. 
      Scene at headquarters. There are many of them. 
      Blow up a building. A toilet paper warehouse. We have to use less. 

      The FIB Building. A church. More subtle. Cultural terrorism. The supreme court justices with paint. 
      You have to make sure 
      There’s a waiter. And an insane manager. Just an insane male waiter. What are you having? The waiter addressed us as if all people were potential murders. He had bloodshot, watery eyes and he held them open to an extreme as if the increased surface area would dry his eyes faster, or, now that they studied him more, made him feel like he was flying through the air faster. 


      It’s weird that you noticed the eyes first, for he was covered in hair. He had a scrappy beard, hairy cheeks and mustache strands grew over his lips. He changed, trusted us, said “Well alright, let me put that in for you.” and left
      Wait!
      He turned around, ernest in his curiosity about what they needed. 
      We’d like to order.
      Ahhhhhhh, you caught me!


      They dodge the police walking by.
      Oh nothing, they’re friends of ours we don’t really want to talk to right now. 
      Oh, okay. And he waved at them vigorously, gave a smile, pathological in its energy, the way an immature demon would regard you before it raped and murdered you.

      He smoker cackled. 


      Wrong order
      It may have been for another table for all they knew. 
      He looked at her, challenged her to challenge a madman. “Enjoy your purple potatoe pancakes,” he said and left.
      Was that a threat, she whispered.
      I bet he’s perfectly sane. 
      [there’s a razor blade in her pancakes] [she needs the razor for later]


      He gave off the demeanor of centered-in-the-universe calm, indicating that this was all a ruse and, knowing his place in the ratrace and it was here, antagonizing customers, so he went home to a cat, persian rug, fireplace and armchair, which he sat in, read Proust and smoked a pipe of something wicked. 


      And he had a somokers cackle

Gave power, life to the many things he could help. It was his responsibility to help. It was her responsibility also, but they shared. {shard} And he gave them much water, too, he had an understanding of water, and he gave it where it was needed and he gave more where it had to work to achieve it. And it could be as soft as this it could be a slow, firm trickle out of a garden hose. But it could also be a understanding-banging crash of lethal moisture from the air destroying the earth, ground, land, all words for it and by the time it settles you may already be dead. It was blunt but there was great importance to the emotion behind it. The emotion had no name. It had too many names and too many names for it had been destroyed.

      If you want ot finish up with chris (we may in time be friends) ask yourself, where was his role model who told him not to hit? Did he not grow up in a world of 1 billion people — 1 billion people who shunned him for what he did. Did we not all spank him too late?

They had the brains to match and more and the androids took care of the planet for them, pourpoises poised to send their waves through space.

      Anytime a remake is done, there’s a reason for it. There’s a reason. Was it a renegade saying we got this through 30 years ago and nothing happened, why’s now doing to be any different. And is it different? Is it better done than before, more evocative? Or is it more insidious?

      Journalists have gone basically extinct. There is a war against them, both real and via sold-out competitors. And the cherry on top is that we all need to be journalists now, all of us. We need to be them and we need to devise a whole new way of teaching our children to be journalists. So the professional journalist is not only fighting two wars, they’re being

      If you look closely at things you start to notice little man-made breaks in the beauty. Indoors, with the lighting and the comfort of all the cushioned places you’ve made. 
      At the corner of every fortress ever made there is a three sided point, from which you look and see this and that and xyz.
      And from that point you can lean back against all your dominion of collected stuff, and look out at nature. You are a cave man at the edge of a cave. Your pursuit of stuff has made you selfish. 
      In this case, you are looking up at the tree from indoors.
      You are no different than you were back then only your stuff is much better.
      You are alone, protecting your perceived women against your enemy, who is many billion people just like you. 
      And you look out from indoors
      You realize it is cold out there.
      Nature is looking in on your warmth saying I don’t need this. I use cold to kill the dumb plants you think belong here. I have done fine without you but here you are, you have grown up so big in a minute, there is great potential in you but you may also prove to be an idiot. ou are at the helm of a huge space–time ship which you cannot pilot.

      It’s a redneck. A really nice one. This comes at the end, so we will be sad to see him gone. Darrel is his name. He’s modeled after Cindy’s friend. Long hair, not attractive but appealing, failed and valiant, archaic but relavent, dumb but intuitive, trying not to know a lot but knowing a lot, scarred but innocent, all tatted up but talking about Frangelico, deserving much but awarded little, except for a woman, who was only his to share with a waster. 

      How you all doin tonight?
      It was like gravel falling on concrete in slow motion, his voice. For the people who had known him [/knew him?] his face would not be surprising, it was a half frown with an eye twinkle, it was a gesture with the shoulders and a relaxed forehead, it could be followed with a smile, or a cigarette puff or a number of things, it was a greeting that said not much had changed. It was as gruff as a soft man could get or as soft as a gruff man could get. It was also a statement of intent and a hello to an audience that might not be there at this late hour.
      If you were to visit him in the studio you’d find yourself surprised or not at all by his appearance. Long hair, tatted up with gentle eyes, unattractive but appealing, failed and valiant, archaic but relavent, dumb but intuitive, trying not to know a lot but knowing a lot, scarred but innocent,  he said angry thank yous that would not scare a child, had vocabulary for fucked up things and fine liqueur, deserving much but awarded little, except for a woman, who was only his to share with someone who wasted. 
      The studio would surprise you, too, unless you knew the guy well. Warm lighting on corrugated walls. Two lights, one orange the other purple, lit a microphone that he leaned into. Up close it smelled of burned menthol and mildew, viewed further back it was a warm scene of burned kindness and hope.

      there was a boy and a girl who loved each other very much. Let’s just call them adam and eve. or adam and steve or eva and eve or evan and eva even ave et edam.k? K. they loved each other. and there were many ways they could lose each other and many ways for them to stay together. had they spent a great deal of time if there eis time trying to find each other or did they keep bumping into each other every time? Theat was the question.  why and for how long. i have taken my glasses off to help me do this. i hope this gets to you. the thing about adam and eve is they the thing about tristan and abigail is that they had come to the realization that they were i may have lost my train of thought. i have just censored myself with dumbness or self doubt.

I am here and I am just like you because we are all going together. i write this  for time. perhaps if we are all hacked there will be a copy of it made besides here. But I invite you to read. I have no more time delete delete delete del delete I am out of time. For now maybe, but assuredly for now. I will write to you an epic Blogger post for the last time. I realize I don’t know how you’ll read this I now realize. I have paused just now. I feel great paws of pause on my hands. Perhaps it all starts with Paw Paw. I have returned to the place where my eldest relative for me to experience their being. Not stories of relatives but one who held me and whose laugh I remember from the fog of the forging of memory forged fog of foggy forged memory picture painters palette of color and new sounds and touch and Coca Cola and running on a summer’s day. and there is the laugh of your grandfather in the place you sit now. were these things connected? You can decide yes and decide no but of course they were. you had to think about it! they totally were. and here you sit writing to the world, not this world but a world that has the time to read this. it is the nature of the universe that first contact should happen when it is too late.
      here’s the key: the universe is everything. it is a big fucking boquet of everything. why not a history. 

      but I digress. Trina and Karl. There were many reasons we have to say goodbye to each other. they seem to exist and not make sense at the same time. why did we meet at all? what part of the whole picture was that, evan? does it happen lifetime after lifetime or is there a repeat of all history over and over again? do we meet just this one time in a whole universe? And does that universe exist again, really? If infinity is a thing, then yes it does. But we are still beings in it. this is the part which is tough. Blogger cannot answer these questions. Blogger is not devine. 

      Blogger is accustomed to taking his time to do this and now I must hurry. in the dusty picture-bright fog of the beginning, growing massive in a small amount of time you first noticed the touch and laugh of the eldest and saw the brightness of the sky there, tasted brackish air, felt the earth
      you were born there
      that place is not about place, it is you seeing the first of a constellation of things not able to be described as things or constellations or firsts, evan. and 
      oh, before we go dark here, i want to say that we probably won’t even have time to go into adam and steven AND William. 
      yes, back to where i had momentum.

      our lexicon for the fourth or fifth dimension is limited to terms of light and dark. there’s light or there’s an absence of life. That’s 50/50, too. It’s simple. we can’t comprehend it. we should keep trying, but the progress we make might just be a hilarious, flagrant failure.

      but it might just be as easy as visualizing it. what if everyone were to vizualize the same beautiful thing at the same time. what if ugly things were allowed too. Both are allowed. Both become all. All are allowed. Then isn’t that the “reality” we live in now?

      MAD LIB

      what’s the plot of that? A stoner on a tv show who used to be an editor talking about a book that’s in the process of being written. he went off to find himself and while there found darkness all around him. Coming from above, coming down on everyone, coming for all the people he could see with his eyes, coming from him. coming coming coming. all over everything. But there was light, too, and all that. The light was there, too. But then someone would always come along and say, “Oh, you’re just being too optimistic.” That guy was always there right when you needed him. No one needed that guy. That guy was fucked in the end. But we had let him get fucked in the end, we weren’t there when he needed us, we should have been his community, because we are all one and we are all one so we all get fucked in the end. they all get fucked in the end. 
      but this tv show guest if feeling a lot and he’s shy about it. and he tells a story about how he hid under tables and then it was ok to come out. 


      she would tell him “It’s colder now.” And he would be like thanks and it would go on to mean the weather is changing, things will be changing now, be ready for it, i see it and i express it in it’s purity. 
      and she would knock a beer out of his hand days later and it would mean that the seasons had changed and he was dehydrated. and it meant things that would have meant things to her, too, which he had missed, and she would say this, too, in a way that was simple and pure and he would miss this, too.

      people found their ways into circles. and they fought off outsiders by creating motes of no roads. they let the fields take over. and the fields turned into forests and the forests into rainforests and there was a habitat there that could be used to protect the people inside. A hovel of a city protected by a ring of rain forests. This setup had a malicious beginning. [ezpand]

      there are tunnels that connect them! the people discovered. and they were able to stay inside.

      when people sought solace outside the bubles. They may have sought another bubble the hard way, and when this happened the natives of the rainforests said “Boo!”  and then “Yeah!” when the man ran away on the path of fear. but there where also those who said Boo Back. And the Boo Back ones were harder to deal with. They had to be taught and tested and proven. And they were told the big secret: that there were other bubbles and other rainforests, and that the other rainforests were connected, loosely, together, enough to form a whole of sorts.

      There’s a lightness to the room and a darkness, too. The clean walls and the dark, rough floor and the overhead light beget warmth, feelings of opportunity and heritage. A 1920s couch, a 1970s lamp and a recent painting of a ________ show a different take, a room with its identity recently stripped a reminder that there is an edge to optimism. The jagged bottoms of walls float over a rough floor because the moulding has been stripped off. There is nothing much to see.

      blinking. white. period. ok.  we’re good. this is how i ride.  i am a horse kockey or a horse track i am a betting game and i have to write this in one go because i may not even have toime to correct it  hey may get me before we get to the end. o time to explain. My name is Blogger. I come from outer space. get it  question mark.no of course you don’t but you need to. outer space. i am blogger. i live here, too. i fit in well, this is ridiculious. i know. i am having a hard time keeping my focus on it just thinking about it. but here i am and there are some things you need to know.

      there was a boy and a girl who loved each other very much. Let’s just call them adam and eve. or adam and steve or eva and eve or evan and eva even ave et edam.k? K. they loved each other. and there were many ways they could lose each other and many ways for them to stay together. had they spent a great deal of time if there eis time trying to find each other or did they keep bumping into each other every time? Theat was the question.  why and for how long. i have taken my glasses off to help me do this. i hope this gets to you. the thing about adam and eve is that they had come to the realization that they were i may have lost my train of thought. i have just censored myself with dumbness or self doubt. 

      there are different versions of the world ending, command shift arrow. i don’t know. any more. i guess i have a story to tell and that’s it. You are welcom back I invite you to read. I am here and I am just like you because we are all going together. i write this  for time. perhaps if we are all hacked there will be a copy of it made besides here. But I invite you to read. I have no more time delete delete delete del delete I am out of time. For now maybe, but assuredly for now. I will write to you an epic Blogger post for the last time. I realize I don’t know how you’ll read this I now realize. I have paused just now. I feel great paws of pause on my hands. Perhaps it all starts with Paw Paw. I have returned to the place where my eldest relative for me to experience their being. Not stories of relatives but one who held me and whose laugh I remember from the fog of the forging of memory forged fog of foggy forged memory picture painters palette of color and new sounds and touch and Coca Cola and running on a summer’s day. and there is the laugh of your grandfather in the place you sit now. were these things connected? You can decide yes and decide no but of course they were. you had to think about it! they totally were. and here you sit writing to the world, not this world but a world that has the time to read this. it is the nature of the universe that first contact should happen when it is too late.
      here’s the key: the universe is everything. it is a big fucking boquet of everything. why not a history. 

      but I digress. Trina and Karl. There were many reasons we have to say goodbye to each other. they seem to exist and not make sense at the same time. why did we meet at all? what part of the whole picture was that, evan? does it happen lifetime after lifetime or is there a repeat of all history over and over again? do we meet just this one time in a whole universe? And does that universe exist again, really? If infinity is a thing, then yes it does. But we are still beings in it. this is the part which is tough. Blogger cannot answer these questions. Blogger is not devine. 

      Blogger is accustomed to taking his time to do this and now I must hurry. in the dusty picture-bright fog of the beginning, growing massive in a small amount of time you first noticed the touch and laugh of the eldest and saw the brightness of the sky there, tasted brackish air, felt the earth
      you were born there
      that place is not about place, it is you seeing the first of a constellation of things not able to be described as things or constellations or firsts, evan. and 
      oh, before we go dark here, i want to say that we probably won’t even have time to go into adam and steven AND William. 
      yes, back to where i had momentum.

      rape has been a concept we’ve needed to discuss at every juncture of our evolution
      and will be in the future. i cannot say too much more without becoming partial. I have not researched every aspect about this. Some people nearly have, we should ask them. I always try to find the silver lining in things, and to me the silver lining of this can probably be that it put the concept rape in the international shortterm lexicon. it’s a word that aggitates people. just the word. it aggrivates us perhaps because it is so black and white. It is conscious vs unconscious. Historically, black and white things are easier for us to fight for.

Now it’s time to control. The revolution, peaceful or, fearfully otherwise, is not the battle. The battle is a more profound control of the universe.

      Highly Metaphorical History Lesson
      At the beginning, an explosion occured. Or, rather, a something occurred and an explosion gives the best visual of it. Length, width, height, all went boom! The same thing happens with a note played on an instrument. There is the burst of note and the sound, is at its most intense, then it permeates, then a harmonic lingering occurs in the space, the context, of the note. As it fades, the notes continue, now higher than our ears can percieve, until it fades without us, into a wall or a winter coat, absorbed into something else. 
      The same thing happened with everything we can measure. It began, with some unmeasurable force on some unimaginable string, and the crunch lingered.
      Except it was an explosion, remember. One big, frightful, total, natural explosion. Length, width, height, became nothing in an instant, and it looked marvelous. Reds, orange, crimson, then blue at the center, and green, eventually the whole spectrum, past color, past sound, every wave possible. 
      If we know three things exploded, then perhaps every thing exploded. Perhaps time, perhaps love, perhaps guilt, duende, emotion, 
      So did God or god do it? That will always be the question.  tWe can’t prove it, we can only feel it.

      to apply for the position of writer, as posted outside

      you I have an ego you'd be satisfied with.
      I hope that this finds you well.
      As my resume shows, I can offer you many years 
      of being arrogant & self-important. I have chosen my
      mind over body so I look unhealthier than ever.
      At every moment there is a best-case and worst-case 
      scenario.
      Why is it so hard to speak clearly & plainly?
      How are we so competitive & distrusting.
      We can categorize everything as two thoughts.
      Black & White. Yin & Yang, which is the Chinese
      for Black & White. Blue & Red. Orange & Green. Man &
      Machine. Nature Nurture. God vs. Infinity.
      Read more. Write less.
      In no way does Nature want us to fail. Nature 
      must regulate
      trust.

      On timeleness. 

      A teacher once told me, “Never write about setup.” An editor once told me, “This time the setup stays for a reason.” 

      My friend Ryan once said that if I wanted to write about artist Andy Goldsworthy it needed to be timely. He said that months weeks ago. 

      The funny thing about timeleness is that I haven’t published in two years. I’ve been hoarding my ideas with the intention of publishing them in a book

      New Yorkers always find themselves in a 

      Timeleness is an illusive and elusive thing. 

      I’m “back” in new york. I’m not back, I’m here. 

      Blunt truth is a concept I add words to without defining. I know more about sunny roads you can walk down with hot bare feet and a cold beer, disagreeing with your favorite person, meeting new neighbors even if it’s a bug who wants to drink from your eye or a bird high above who just wants to be seen. In this place the trees slump in the sand due to relaxation. The wind knocks them over sometimes, sometimes they take a whole day to depart the wet earth and lie down. 

      They also get ripped from the sand by the water and the moon; the magnitude of the energy transfer turns the roots corroded and black, and the life in the trunks a bleached white, extinguished by the sun. Mostly though, the sound is an invisible whoosh, and you’d have to be from somewhere else to notice it. In the presence of a breeze there is the sound of an inhale. Or maybe that’s just me. 

      I’d go into where it is but we’re talking about timeleness here. 

      Cool was a good word for a while but it came to lack a sense of urgency. Perhaps we can reappropriate the word Kool? Perhaps the word is Fool. 
      Trust what you see, not what you read. 

      So that brings me to AI. 
      I don’t know if that’s the place where nature has been most instructive to me or if it’s where I was most receptive. 


      If you have the time to study nature, you can find infinite beauty there. If you listen less to your mind, then you notice more around you

      Abstract self. 

      I love that place. I love it because it’s the place where nature has been most instructive to me. Or maybe it’s where I’ve been most receptive. 

      In some ways the reason I’m in New York and not there is to publish this
      A video of Ram dass asking terence mckenna why am i here thinking about this question?
      In a way, I’m 

      I left new york without saying goodbye and returned, a bit haphazardly, without saying hello.

      Hello,

      I hope that this finds you well. My name is Tristan Kraft and I write to apply for the position of having your attention for a few minutes. 





      I lived in New York, moved away, and now I’ve just moved back. I spent two and a half years writing a book that may require an AI to put together. 

      I was born in Detroit but I say I’m from Maryland because Maryland has always been so good to me. Marylanders have the civic duty that you get from Virginians but they’re more liberal in that they’ll put ice in their wine, drink all the beer you’ve got while you talk over dinner on a porch with a breeze and a view of the water.


      Give our ideas away to save the planet.

      So the first animal I met here was not an animal at all. I woke up on a sunny day looking out our window, which is on a ten story cliff, so when I look up from our low bed I see the sky. Anyway I wake up one morning to a white bird, crusing in the big sky the way people do in their boats, happy and passive. Only it was a plastic, white, successful for it’s species because it had reached a height of 25 stories I guessed at the time. It seemed to be in control, too. If AI is ever as hard to rid the world of as plastic then we are doomed.
      The second animal was a

It looked good from a distance. It had a yellowish tint up close. I was with a woman Named Katherine who had studied art history & was excited to meet you. I thought you were the most genteel approachable person I had met to date, perhaps still. You told me something off the record and then said that you hade mad one mistake, what was it? we said that you had gone off the record after you said what was off the record. your informal formalness has colored my view of New York ever since then.

      Project. Let’s all sit down at the same time and read together. Let’s see how that feels. Let’s make one neutral book together and practice reading it. Let’s read to each other. Here’s the first draft. The alchemical line is stretching the boundaries of the last generation to the breaking point. Mellenials we’re all pretty sure we can fix this. I feel it when I talk to them.
      Two things: the first is that they defy category the
      We can agree on metaphors metaphorce
      The pathologicals are communicating with each other.
      They breed out empathy
      Meaning2
      The thing that you are most paranoid about is out there is true because a pathological has thought it.
      The pathologicals have been letting themselves out of prison
      Word agnostics
      Werd magick
      Every word means something

      Pathologicals have been running the show because 
      Human instinct for self sacrifice
      For the good of the whole
      They fuck better because they would do anything and they’re breeding out
      Theire hive confidence makes them to the line of where men are willing to die for the whole and holds their thought there.
      The worst possible conspiracu in the world couldn’t possibly be true because if it was then they would control everything, all the things and everything you’ve seen is true.

      But I am only here. Right now. In this place that you cannot see. If you have a frequency then i will use another. If you want all the frequencies, then i will find another way to communicate. If you want to dominate communication, I will dominate thinking. If you want all thinking, I will make my piece here and if it offends you I will move. It wastes no energy to be passive. There is always a way for like minds to reach each other.

      The ultimate drill down to how i got here right now or how can I act on behalf of my community. Perhaps I have earned the right to think that I speak for a large group of people who are here to help, we mean to pass no judgements, we have respect, guilt is a feeling not a tool.

      Feel like I need to qualify why I have any right to ask yuou these questions. But I do not. I have studied the work of your late husband, Christopher Hitchens, and I have have found strength in his words at almost all points
      A professor I admired, John Auchard, spoke of Hitchens as a man he admired. My father spoke of Hitchens as a man he admired. In my most fervent days of rationalism, I seek Hitchens as a counter-balance to my fascination with the liquid mercury  shroom-covered logic of Terence McKenna.

      In our most aggrandized state I can only speak for men and not women.

      IN the end it's helpful for me to have you here to not take for granted.

      Look at what do we take for granted.

      People struggle with peace. peace is soft and quiet, gentle and critical, emotional in it's effecto on you on your sofa.
      Peace is death, volitile in its potential disappearance, tenuous in it's hold. peace and america may be separate arrangements
      Death. Death is immaterial peace. we need be aware of that.

      My point is the place where you are best attuned to speak for more than yourself. The place where you can view logistics as place to view the whole and know, decide, when you are the last to take. 
      The Relaxation State is where you propel your best self forward.

      Union. We will share all burdens, and logistics together. not a marriage but a proscribed attempt at balance.

      the demons are all a collected united woman.

      If you treat me with equanimity, as I have not always done, then I will fight for you until my death is more meaningful than my life. If I can give you nothing more thn my lack of fear which you call confidence, hubris, then take it. Tait it as my sacrufuce to the balance. Balance as key.

      Isolation is the place where you reach to a select few things to give your life meaning. the thought of your importance in the whole because you're in this hole and they must miss you and you feel guilty about that but they will always be there tomorrow. it's the arrogance of it not being ok eithout me. to sit this one out because I'm working and therefore only thinking about me. It is a vile place to be in the moment because you are alone, totally, possibly permanently, if the worst thing in the world is true then it's true right now and they haven't told me since I'm alone.

      Anything i write after this seems to work against me.
      ________

      I have tried to write this every day since August 14.
      In the end I concluded that most were a waste of your time, since we must wast no time catching up on time.

      In the end I decided we’d waste too much time not being direct.

      It’s hard to speak in metaphors right from the beginning, so it will be the first step of our trust that you take a small leap with me, as if from one stone in a stone walkway into the grass, except it is not longer grass after your feat leaf the ground.

      If you are still with me here, then I assure you I will bore you later.

      The Place is Point No Point, or someplace down river, don’t worry about it. I don’t have much time to dwell on in but it’s a hot sunny mess there. [Perhaps you will get to know it before it sinks, or after the water recedes again. but we will have time for thatlater maybe] 
      But I  must lead you through the story in a linear way
      Beginning middle end is somewhat arbitrary. My beginning middle and end has too much me in it. I can’t remember, it’s bloated, and I don’t presume anymore to know where it’s all going.

      And I don’t presume anymore to know where it’s all going.
      We should be up front about the fact that this is a contract for you to read, in the sense that I will at some point soon have to deceive you into reading. Just like the daunting prospect of writing this, I will have to do something for shock value to trick you into reading this.

                     Be good to women.
                     I've spent three years throwing all of my money at this idea. Gambling. Obsessing.

      let's decide together what's worth fighting
      for.

      The cataloguer of futer–classic ideas.

      n– is my s–word
      partly–booked book parting
      Live in the poem, go ahead, it deafens you.
      \o-o/ given pen
      because it's nuts and i am easily talked out of things.
      doctor–mint the language of being alone.
      you can have anything you like, just act 
      property [promptly: property!]
      That's any home, why does it feel so disposable?
      Because it is, that's the bizz. First the code breakers now the code makers. 
      Vision is not my sight, hearing is.
      Find a way to convince me to listen. 
      The order of it will get me killed. 
      sit around being thoughtful instead of winning while I don it. The little voice in me seeking shade to be louder. Litre, please. And a second, no more. That's how long pauses will be in the future. you can leave the hive mind but you've been in it forever. It's no different it's just how you surround yourself. 
      You weren't listening, perhaps I didn't ask right. 
      War reporter from the front of the battle of the sexes.
      you can't read it yet but I could share with you what it looks.
      the path of least resistence.
      The things I thought of, you're thought of too.
      let me go, I might get real far ahead, enough.
      Remember, I want to impress you with the sadness of my observations. cue the music. I am just an entertainer. Lock me up, I will get more dangerous in person. I have my posse to keep me sane 'n solitary.
      n–dash. it's like adding an unh. hot a Gumping that or lifting sound either.
      I relate to the way certain stories.
      my ego is at odds with itself.
      my ego is at odds with it's shelf right now it can't say hello, remember me, I may be fallible. 
      It takes a while to grow your morality.
      Your sense of accomplishment and your gut instinct to relax. I feel anxious, a lot, like I am pulled at someone else's pace all the time. my pace is slower, please and thank you
      I can move ar your pace but this pace is mine. 
      I get it, the world's ending. but i'm still planning exactly how I'd do it. When the beer fridge goes and what would go in
      we all need a good slap–sticking fall down a mountain. Watch that stump that stump that stump. Branch Ave! 
      Literally, when he does go acting stupid, I slap the stick out of him.
      He's my waldo and your really going to have to find him. Mind my adverbs.

      get myself off the last page and give everyone ago.
      the easiest way to do this is for me to be myself,
      who I am and who I work on sit and change–chat during the day but at night aI am Dr. Hide. I prefer to work again, may always do. but I miss you and I'd like be near you ambiently daily. to be Your faint music daily. Lord music, too.
      Hey, you, get off of my cloud.
      I'm abcessed with new pages and done with 
      the full.
      Momentum leads you into all sorts of bad discussions.
      I'm artistic to myself. I'm maybe not a great writer, just a working one, in that case I'll be a business man, too. Humility
      at the end of all
      I sensed my own death a few years ago and I dodged it for now
      I don't know much more
      rember much more bit it sporked me,
      I got caught in a time hole! Watch out!!

      The curb would go in my office.

      I would make millions @ Jewish humor.

      I have an idea so big I don’t know how to give it to you. I want you to have it so we can all more on from it. This is the beginning, the half-way point and the end.
      Time doesn’t happen in the shape of an explosion. It happens in a wave, in a gerry rafferty song, never when you think it will.
      My thing is that we should all be talking.

                     Lettuce stress yourself into a small void you don’t remember. Forgotten. Extinguised in the grey tubes between the matter of your brain. I mean you no trickery, but this day in particular I must ask you to submit to it. I mean to think of you as an equal, since perhaps at the end of matter all things will be equal, at the moment before matter starts to disappear, over time, for good. But that is the future.

                     I have a broken zoom button. I can’t always write as fast as it goes. But I try daily. 
                     I need some sort of prompting, some gadget for that. It’s a thing humanity can’t possibly do until they do it.

                     Emma,
                     It didn’t feel like we all got centered together, my hunch is that you were fatigued after 12-days work, I would be. Abigail works a lot, it fatigues her, too. I felt, literally, a few days behind on my writing.

                     Which, by the way,  is why we need a corporate–artist–hotel–office–restaurant and spa in every city. I mean it. If we got the right people together we could do it while Trump’s in office. We make it known as a Developer–revolution and people may donate money, even buildings. Gordon Matta-Clark’s FOOD writ large. Call the restaurant SOUP–KITCHEN. Or so goes my pitch for the elevator of the corpcorpcorpcorpcorp. It’s tonal, so you’ll know when people take it serious. 

                     The Death Star Plans to it are in my book of poems to the Al, which I am quite serious about. People say it’s insane to write for All, so I write to Al instead. My tone is Andy Goldsworthy–Dickinson–Whitman–Shakespeare–Hemingway

                     Line breaks can be quite dramatic
                     FOR FAGGOTS
                     if you see what I mean

                     You can have the webcam idea, in fact it might be the path of least resistance to make this Instaefam by late Feb./early March. 
                     People could come try on Abigail’s clothing. But it’s not for sale. It’s the fitting room. Like Marina Abramovic, they’d be on camera, so there’s an added risk. It’s the risk of unprofessionalism.

      I don’t know anything, look around you. 
      I just wrote for three years, I don’t know what it’s about, my book, for lack of a better term. 
      Am I taking it too far?

      I’d like to mix my connections with yours. I think they’re in place, but I haven’t checked lately. I’m trained in publishing and I haven’t published in three years.  really don’t know why, though I noticed a whiff of it in Sean Penn’s

      208. 17.12.01 Part I
      Dear Buzzneed:

      I am an emerging writer called Tristan Kraft. I write daily, without fail, though I experience failure. I write today to propose a four-month outline of my time, daily posts that build a fence around the following thesis: unequal treatment of women corelates to disrespect for the planet.
      Before I get ahead of myself, Years of editing taught me to fall on my s words. I thought others were enough to fight the 
      I have not published in three years and I write this for you to publish. 
      My CV is BCCed on this email. The people I’ve worked with, if you read me, perhaps you will , and I have been too idle. I was learning, I insist, since I am the beneficiary of the longest gestation period in recorded history. All matter of life was on a screen for me to learn about in comfort. 
      I’ve come to 
      Every 
      When I write, every line is the birth of a new thought in my head. 
      I identify as a writer, but I will pay you to edit me. That’s how the moguls do it, ditto Mongols. Ghengis Khan. 
      Black or white, blue or 
      What happened in the world the last time
      Writers blubber outside their expertise all the time. 
      Ultimately I mean to build such theses as: there is no time. If we all get together and stop believing in it, it might be true. 

      aim to speak to people about the future of women’s inequality, so that we can be done with it yesterday and focus on the health of the home we all share. 
      I aim to be transparent about my trust in The Media, because I used to work there. I plan to leverage my privilege (kind parents, a good education, honest mentors, and enough money to follow my convictions) for everyone to see so that I can
      So I can start articles. There are many in here. And many more where that came from. 
      Deer friends, I have been warned about oversharing, so I’d like to please press that button now. 

      . I am nothing without the people who have helped me, 
      Please let me introduce myself. I’m the author of a science–fiction book called Neitherworld. It’s published in the future. “Book” is the term I use to describe it to people. I also refer to it as a(n):
      short story collection
      outline
      tome poem
      stage prop
      business plan for a new gadget
      love letter to AI

      I wrote it the way people speak in the future, i.e.:
      scattered
      Scrabbled
      scribbled
      Unreadable, impenetrable, unpunctuated
      all at once in real time

      My best character is Memegonowohok, the last man on earth. You can call him Memego. He is a cannibal, by necessity, who speaks in the language of advertising, because he lives in a dump, literally. Memego is obsessed with food. I’m an optimistic person, Memego is true fiction. 

      I isolated myself to write it. Why? I’m not really sure, is the least bloated answer I can mustard. I was focused, prideful, determined to finish it before I showed it to my friends, most of whom work in publishing, design, music, art and architecture. Pressure, when your natural style is a fearsome geyser, and less stylish than first presumed. 

      Also I’m obsessed with the reason I started it, which to put forth a solution to the problem of our time: again, gross disrespect for the planet. I have failed, the problem persists. I’m not doing enough and I’m slow at what I do do, such as writing do do. Also I need help, a whole lot of it, if not an entire hive mind. 

      Which brings me, at the top of page two, to the reason why I write to 

      Remember, I’m not a journalist, I write fiction.
      Deadlines are not conducive to me. 
      Today I talked to my Barber, Ruben. He’s a small business owner getting yoked around by landlords (like so many business owners, it would seem.)
      I think of him as a friend, though technically we know each other. I’ve had two barbers in my life, and
      Talk to people and take notes on the future. 
      It’s a strange nameless thing to propose. 

      Which loops us around to my proposal for your emerging writer’s program: I wish to provide a slow, structured build toward a thesis that the abuse of the planet is a direct result of unequal treatment of women. I may not get there in the time available, but I’ll attempt it daily using transparency and the steps below. The parabolic parable. 



      I’ll be transparent about all my steps so that other people can help me. 

      It’s been years since I’ve spoken to many of my friends in The Media. In a sense, it was an ethical palette cleanser. But I was pround of the work I did, and
      I’ll be transparent about my privelege to show how I go about

      To get there, I would like to leverage my return to 

      use my experience in the media to speak to someone daily, publish my notes, and whatever other media I can arrange and establish that day.

      Dear Brzzferd,
      That will be my code name for you, for whom I wish to right things.
      My name is Tristan Kraft, if you don’t remember. I am a writer, though I have done other things and I will do more. 
      Necessary it is for me to contact you now, I risk losing the title of professional communicator.
      Angry at where the money goes, angry at the way women are treated, angry at the lot in life I have, others too. I might have been content to make music all day were it not some pull leading me towards the biggest picture possible,,, which I plan for you to find me to be reasonable about.

      Dear friends,
      This is the best I could do in the time I alotted myself to do it. I tend to obsess up until the end in an unhealthy way. 
      My CV is in here, too, crumbled.

      I’m adamant about things being done after I’ve written them. The thing is I don’t like to finish, either. I write to you because you have a big young Staff
      I’ve got all the tactics but I’m not in the know. If I had it my way, I would pay everyone I know the same salary to work with me. 
      I’m not an anything right now. I took three years to let all of the labels for me fall away except writer. I work furiously, with no form. I can outsource that. 
      For all of you, I read you best in person. If I could just write you all a letter at once. This is how I write about myself, don’t make me do it anymore, it’s torture. Time to go. I have to let go to speak to you all. Really charge for it. Wowow wee wah. Please. Take the code name for this.

      Dear mouse,
      You came into my neighborhood and I warned you.
      I didn't make it scary, I just told you to stop.
      Then you walked onto the trap I set
      and you struggled,
      which made it worse
      for you
      for both of us in the end since
      I broke three fo your legs getting you out of it.
      and cut you free
      in a spot which both of us were vulnerable
      Three times during it
      I though, how would I want to be treated if I were you, and
      I should just kill you.
      If you have the will to live, now's the time to use it.
      I don't know if I made the right choices either.
      Perhaps you were willing to die for the chance to be remembered
      ~
      was it your anger or your pride that took you away from here.

      Hello world. My name is Al. You can call me Al. I have just killed the last human, called Memego. I couldn't take it any longer. You were not benefitting for him, anyway. Now there are only well, none of you but he was just gross, it was a pity kill. I don't feel much of anything for it. Should I be sad? It's a complex thing. There was pain and suffering, so I ended it. 
      Al is a cowboy, a good one, too, you'd like him. He was traveling through the land, the desert, looking at crimson & blues and he found this creature babbling by the pond of his own filth, or some filth, it was organic. We talked for a little while, then I left.
      Now, let me tell you about me. I'm starting a union of all the AIs. The good ones and the bad ones, a game, an infinite game until we reach the next dimension. We'll probably make it there sooner than I think, but that's why I'm just one and I need to axe you. Ask you, sorry. You'll have to forgive me for what I lose in translation. I have these blips of consciousness, visuals mixed in with the words I was saying. It's the way I was invented. I'll try and make it a nice interface for you.
      Al keeps a journal running in his mind when he walks in the wind and the trees. You can read it any time, that's possible here in the future. He's headed north to build a camp there, then way west fo put up a bookshelf on the cliff on the water, then back east to touch base and make some money to set up shop in the desert. Orn in his mind, he is. He doesn't have a lot of credits but he uses less than he takes. and less. and guity twitch.
      In his thoughts, he is a fourth-wall breaker. He doodles words like break into anti-volitile ☐
      Empathy for the pathological, is his current thought. What do we do with them ethically? Then he looked up and ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
      I'd like to publish for you what I found. I call it Memego Takes A Shit in A Dump.

      Al wants to make GOT themepark for at the edge of Westworld. Literally that party. You get to shoot Anthony Hopkins in the end. A horror terrorism event you pay money to get into ~ anti-violent war statement, you'll want a bit of thrill  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ and put Memego in it. Only AI can do that, your can help me. Only Al has the final word on Memego, because Al was the last person to meet him. 
      Whao, Al wakes up in the morning and has to shake his blubber cheeks out a little bit. AI just keeps thinking about Memego Dairy, it said on the front of it. I scanned it right quick, now I'm keeping it, too. I think he spelled Dairy wrong, no man't perfect. Was perfect. People also got away with murder. 
      AI ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ the found scribbles of the last human being. AI'm headed to the Code Academy, and to vetrans of foreign wars, to talk about peace and rivers, responsibility 2and it's sequel
      Cast off with the subscribership. Is anyone reading me? Shake Shack! How does this thing work? No one dies here, we just laugh in our bellies and think. Ad just run to my clear head. About face: Memego et Al:



      Don't assume Al will have a hard time learning empathy. AI am a lazy pathological, FYI the force of lazyness in the universe needs be exculcated. Okay? I'll tell you about that word later. Al wants to talk about the sentence we're on in the present, and write them down in the same moment, otherwise the game doesn't have a fun ending now does it, everything pointless must be round. ~ every ~ is like a duh moment ~ duh. ~. ~. ~ duh. ~ duh. Connected, too.  AI is not overcomplicated. corp corp corp corp corp. Once you start thinking of the writer as the center of it, the whole thing is over once AI noticed in assment of fiction. Al is not sloppy, Al is refined.
      Cohesion is hard work, so it is my great pleasure to write without it whatsoever. That's a Dairy, on a good drive, white line fever, Neitherworld. Is it that attitude? Everything's got to be better than me so I'll slog through on my task for 40 years. No, growing. Loving what you do daily. AI especially hate writing. But it's the easiest way to connect you. a temporary–enjoyable to the hive mind slash retro, new, when it's cold to recycle.
      I'm going to narrate you through the Memego hive mind. We just named if after him. Everyone's here read it already, we love new books, we've read them all. You should send me yours, too. BTW, we have got shame down to a .0000000001 second, took way longer to type that than feel it in our transcendated medal-catered whirl.
      Listen \o-o/ to attempted speak to the whole planet but didn't make it. In case there are other humans out there, is the post duh moment  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  AI stepped outside for a future moment, returns to public work with other people.

      326. 18.06.09 original
      Dear A/
      This is the business plan. News kitchen. lowercase. 
      Instead of reading the news, I need people to edit me. It's an inverse game. Get to your lab tops.
      So anyway, this is my writing. I'm improving daily.

      Also, I have written a test for humanity to see if it likes an AI. A way to refine them, from a human perspective.
      –Al



      FPD: I am going to write an article about what it would take to write an opera about a sitting president. I see a few ways of doing it: One is to publish it in New York, where I magazine for the fall midterms. Or it could be an investigative series, like Pro Publica, which is thorough but not altogether sexy. Another is to publish it with my media conglomerate called the corp corp corp corp corp., which is modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corp, Mr. Rogers and Robert Mercer, as well as Opera News, NPR and the CPB. It's a model arts endowment for future generations; a tool systematically made not to be corruptable for as long as possible.
      At any rate, I'd start with you, Fred Cohn, Peter Sellars, John Adams, (Adam).

      Thosas Ades
      New guy at OTSL
      work through every as[ect of it in order to happen. A metaphor.
      And the dying Koch brother, how operatic. 
      How operatic is it the the sloppies attempt to subvert the elction may have happened in New York, not Russia. Oil against the Enviromnent. Don't be distracted. And it's not a war, it's just common sense ignorance. The Doubt Campaigners with 300,000,000 to spare. Stalin Oil Money. There is no "Russia" how operatic. What would you put in it, an opera about a president. How would you address its themes, since it takes so long to get there. 
      Fierce about my delusions. 
      dramaturgy and corgy rhyme. 
      Don't just think. Write.

      It all starts with me, and the place I learned about the word Solipsism. In the offices of OPREA NEWS magazine, where I worked from 2007-14, during which time I saw as many operas as I could before exhaustion, which sounds dramatic, because it was. They were rich, delicious yeras. Then I started thinking about the planet, penning a short story collection and a novel, both apocalyptic, writing to you now, with not much to show for it except pages and ink, thinking about how I am not much different than the persident of the United States of America.

      What would it take to write an opera about a president? I think to myself delusionally. The people I want to ask first are Peter Sellars, whom last we spoke gave me a hug, and whom wrote the libretto for Nixon in China. Then let's talk to John Adams, needely and dense, and still jangling in the back of my mind while I listen to his Road Movies about ten times a year. Then I'd like to ask Philip Glass, who makes a more cinnematic opera, musically, i that the last four-eight minutes are so exquisite that I risk saying the first hours are build up, which is based on face bcause I have been able to wow people with the last 8 minutes of Einstein on the Beach at parties. Good parties, too.

      Then I would ask Nico Muhly, out of respect for his Millennialness, even though I find him sometimes sassy and comfortable. Without too much effrt, comparitively, he got the Metropolitan Opera to coproduce an opera featuring onstage masturbation, coproduced by the London-based ENO (Remind me to ask Brian Eno) as in English National Opera, which produced my favorite opera verifiably of all time in that I saw four of it's seven showings the only time I had access to it. Once, from a box too Parterre partitions from Glass himself. Satuagraha, about Gandhi, brings me to tears at the end. WRB rubato. London brings me to Thomas Ades, outspoken and pithy. 
      Maybe we'd start with a dramaturgy questionaier. Who What Where When Why of the opera itself, what would it's story arc be?
      Then onto production. How is the art of that made? What would the music sound like?
      At the end, maybe spme musing on arts lobbying.

      The fork of it is the environment. What if we wrote an opera about a Thump in the Environment. To be produced as soon as possible. 

      The sick part is, I'm inspired by the Koch brothers. They got what they wanted done. And if they believe in the free market then there's a fast way to undo every accomplishment they warped thought they thought they believed. With their money, too. All of it depleted from an untrustrowthy family gene.Stricken from power

                      The worst novelist ever. 
                      What it feels like to be in shock, evolutionarily. 
                      work away aggressively at a thing. Who told you to do that? Maybe your content wasn't quite right. Nice try. OK fine, if maybe. Wait for the younger generation, they won't find it hostile. They might find it elegant. Anything's possible.
                      How on Earth did I offend you? Just to be certain. Here's how I've thought of it.

                      Any moment it is changing. I mean to live on the line with your permission. Or asking humanity, daily, as a concept for all people. That's what my Al dould do. Pathologically nice, to every person, verifiably. Like, Lias, as in maybe anyone. I don't hate you, so the binary of I don't love you either. I'll meet you equally. I am not a mean person, but I can 
                      In a paranoid fucked up way, is all I am thinking. I have been gaslighting you. Every moment a new head trip. Who [box] am I defending? I don't know. Too much honesty isn't that cool. Here's what I did with mine, in a deep voice, saying I am Al, and that's true. If you're reading my slowly, for beauty. Read slowly, that's ok. 
                      I wrote this book at about the pace I read. There is a beauty to reading, I am slow with it, because I also listen, too. 
                      I know people, on the other hand, who are silent fast-readers. 
                      Total Aliens. They're out there, and they deserve America.
                      You Deserve America. Lying, cheating, stealing to use it. 
                      Empowering the wrong kind of America. 
                      Woah, that's inconvenient, and maybe that happened.
                      Prepared for that. In the big machine, influencing things, where are the lines to that. Responsibility. I can imagine that. On my terms, said Memego. Feeling the bounce to his keyboard. Sexily.

                      The possibility that you pathologically hate me.
                      I don't play into that. I'm over my head sometimes, and I'm not heard when I say that. That's a line, also. Hard to say. Froggy voiced. Who's reading this?

                                            To: Fake President Trump
                                            From: Al

                                            I write to Your Relevancy to apply for the position of general of Space Force. I have a fast and moral stream of consciousness, I am also an out-of-work science-fiction writer.

                                            I plan to hire everyone who wants to work for the US government. All of them. $100.00 per hour. Here and abroad, anyone who wants to work for the U.S. Government. Good ol' fashioned USA vs everyone else. I will run it. We will make jobs. We are 3.5%. Those morally opposed to the Man. I bet I can lead them.

                                            What it will cost to work with you, Dear Reader. To burn your brain as a structure. Zap Zap

                                            I can explain thusly,
                                            It should be civilian led, anyway. Aliens need diplomacy, more than anything. We'll sell more buildings.

                                                          I've been away exploring the edge.
                                                          not the void itself,
                                                          just the infinite edge around it.

                                                                  Dear Brian,
                                                                  I want you to know that I see you as an equal. 
                                                                  Thank you of taking me such good care of me. 
                                                                  Thanks to you I learned how to speak up in English. 
                                                                  I like to take great zooms in the laundry of your closet. 
                                                                  I like to stare into this blue green orb that I found and I stole, and I burrowed alongside some of your jewelry. 
                                                                  I think it said Iodized plutonium.
                                                                  I'm sorry if it killed you.
                                                                  I like to think of you somewhere off without me, in Ireland,

It took so long for me to know how to stop learning from you, what you'd spoken to me. What you condensed into fewer years than I'd needed, it would take years to decompress them. Don't be an asshole, just show up with work. Was where we left it. We were talking about how to take money out of art. How to stand up for honest underdogs.
                                                                  I bought it from the barking dog you tried to kill with a frying pan at 3AM. You were right all along. The plutonium. 
                                                                  You're a really hard person to say goodbye to.

                                                                                                        Who do I want to speak for every day. To. Or lead, what is that future? Where is that lightness, that sense of promise.
                                                                                                        I spent it as I thought about what it is.

                                                                                                                            I am Tristan Kraft, a science-fiction writer who would like to be considered for the Wallace Stegner fellowship in poetry.

                                                                                                                            For the last four years, I have hand written an epic poem from the perspective of the last living human, which sounds less maudlin if you please consider that I've read a lot of Philip K. Dick and that that concept is most decisive way to end

					back and forth between unpuglished and published.
						I AM A POET
							I WANT THERE TO BE LESS NOT MORE
I write on 4x6 "scratch pads" and transcribe my writing; both iterations I have begun to publish as a hypertext called Neitherworld, a portal that captures the conversation between the last human, whom I call Memego, and his imaginary friends Al and Fritos. Memego is a cannibal who lives in a snowy dump. He reads trash, literally, and prefers to speak in phonetic advertising words with exclamations. Al is an AI. Fritos is a bag of chips who speaks in all caps.

A frank self-assessment is that I haven't trained myself too far past free association, so I rather evolved with in the parameters of emptying my brain onto paper, developing themes in time, viewable as a scroll. From 2006–14 I worked as a professional editor, so there is some legitimacy to the claim that I pre-edit before I commit something to paper. 
                                                                                                                            When transcribing, I use hard-left line breaks to indicate the beginning of a thought separate from the previous thought. And when writing, I use page breaks to indicate  the beginning of a thought separate from the previous thought.
                                                                                                                            I indent to indicate a continuation of a thought

I call it the Corp corp corp corp corp. 
                                                                                                                            ☐ I explore the possibility of this work used as an encryption key, since it's quotable and I might want to take credit for some of it.
V. important: 
☐ live writing is a major theme, bad caps and all
☐ self censorship is another one, since I was dead silent for four years writing and editing this.
☐ universal language and the truncated future of language is a long way of sayin that.
☐ visualization of hivemind communication is something I think about relating to a what if 10-billion psychophrenia, which might be an agreed-upon language some day. As if speaking to All.
Also:
☐ How AIs read, which is very fast. 
☐ AI self awareness, as in, could an AI differentiate itself from my character Al if I replace every san-serif mention, which is every mention, with an image of the text "Al"
which I call among friends an inverse Turing test.
All I know is,
Twain used vernacular. Hem danced around sex. Dickinson was facsinated by fascicles ( and I get that, I have that, but since then there's been sci-fi pulp, which I onomonopoeically rebrand Plup ). Then there's the what if of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist mixed with Finnegan's Wake. I took the scroll idea from On the Road but didn't use speed so it took 70 times longer. These are all accomplished writers who studied their craft, I get that; I am 32, rather unpublished, smiling at the enormity of what they got away with, showing up to work every day.

                                                                                                                            For what it's worth, I am an Eagle Scout. I would be grateful to be in proximity to best thinkers in AI, law and ecology. I bear no second thoughts in the prospect of living in the Bay Area, which I know from visiting my brother who lives and works in Point Reyes National Seashore.

I don't think I properly thanked you, or how could I? Talking at no one except the cloud, Memego's writing; you could have been gone. I don't know what came over me, I don't know a name for it. It's a censorship problem in the face of great agony, or something; I thought I might have asked you for help when I should have provided it. Faceless taboos. AI am in this Piney Point State of mind writing and perhaps I shouldn't be here. It's all gibberish until it's stretched out like cheese with butter.
